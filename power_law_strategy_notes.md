# Power Law Trading Strategy - Key Considerations

## 1. Strategy Overview: Minimize Losses, Maximize Outliers
The core idea is to survive frequent small losses (the "cost of doing business") while patiently waiting for rare, massive winning trades (the "fat tails" or "outliers") that generate the majority of profits.

## 2. Current Implementation and Adjustments

### a. Survival Mechanics (Minimizing Losses) - **STRONG**
Your current setup effectively manages risk and prevents catastrophic losses:
*   **Hard Stop Losses:** All trades require a stop-loss.
*   **Dynamic Position Sizing:** Trade size adjusts based on account balance and `RISK_PER_TRADE_PERCENT` (1%), meaning position sizes shrink during losing streaks, preserving capital.
*   **Max Daily Loss:** A configurable `MAX_DAILY_LOSS` (e.g., £50) acts as a daily circuit breaker.

### b. "Fat Tail" Capture (Maximizing Outliers) - **ADJUSTED**
To truly capture power-law returns, fixed profit targets must be removed, and trailing stops must be set wide enough to avoid premature exits.

**Recent Changes Implemented:**
*   **`src/gemini_analyst.py`:** `take_profit` is now optional. Gemini is instructed to return `null` for `take_profit` and set `use_trailing_stop = True` for breakout/trend strategies to allow uncapped upside.
*   **`src/trade_monitor_db.py`:**
    *   **Breakeven Rule:** The stop is now moved to breakeven only after a trade is `3.0x Risk` in profit (previously 1.5x Risk). This gives trades more room to breathe and reduces premature exits.
    *   **Trailing Stop Activation:** The dynamic trailing stop now also activates only after `3.0x Risk` in profit (previously 1.5x Risk).
*   **`src/strategy_engine.py`:** If `use_trailing_stop` is true, any `take_profit` generated by Gemini is explicitly overridden to `None` during order placement, ensuring wins are not capped.

## 3. Implications of the Power Law Strategy

*   **More Losing Trades:** Expect a lower win rate (e.g., 20-30%). Many trades will hit your initial stop because they don't develop into large trends.
*   **Bigger Winning Trades:** The occasional winning trade can be significantly larger (e.g., 10R, 20R), offsetting many smaller losses. This is where the majority of profits are expected to come from.
*   **Psychological Challenge:** This strategy requires discipline and patience to endure losing streaks, trusting that the "big one" will eventually materialize.

## 4. Survival & Recovery

*   **Survival Runway (Consecutive Losses):** With `1% risk per trade`, you can typically survive around **25-30 consecutive losses** before drawdowns become severe (~25% of account) and recovery becomes challenging. Dynamic sizing helps extend this runway.
*   **"Big Win" for Recovery:**
    *   To recover from 5 consecutive losses (~5% drawdown), you need approximately a **5R** win.
    *   To recover from 10 consecutive losses (~10% drawdown), you need approximately an **11R** win.
    *   To recover from 20 consecutive losses (~18% drawdown), you need approximately a **23R** win.
    *   The deeper the drawdown, the exponentially larger the winning trade required to return to breakeven.

## 5. Hunting "20R" Events (The "Vulture Mode")

*   A **20R** win typically requires a massive directional market move (e.g., 3-4% intraday) without significant reversals. These are rare events.
*   **Past Examples:** August 5, 2024 (Yen Carry Crash), November 6, 2024 (Election Rally), April 14, 2025 (Tariff Volatility). These events might occur only a few times a year.

### The "Vulture Mode" Concept:
It's recommended to trade every open, but adapt the strategy based on market conditions, specifically extreme volatility:

*   **Standard Mode (VIX < 20):**
    *   **Goal:** Grind out small gains, manage small losses.
    *   **Stops:** Standard (based on ATR).
    *   **Expectation:** Keep the account ticking over.

*   **Crisis Mode (VIX > 30):**
    *   **Goal:** Aggressively hunt for 20R+ opportunities.
    *   **Adapt Risk:** **Widen Stop Loss significantly** (e.g., 2-3x normal ATR distance) to accommodate extreme volatility and prevent premature exits by noise.
    *   **Adjust Size:** **Reduce position size** proportionately to maintain the same absolute dollar risk (e.g., if stop is 3x wider, size is 1/3).
    *   **Target:** **Uncapped** (rely purely on trailing stops).
    *   **Rationale:** When VIX > 30, the "price of admission" (stop distance) is higher, but the potential reward from capturing a violent trend is also dramatically larger. If you don't widen stops, you'll be stopped out by noise before the trend can establish.

**Conclusion:** The recent changes to your bot's trailing stop and profit-taking logic align well with a Power Law strategy, enabling it to "let winners run." The next step for optimization is to implement a dynamic "Crisis Mode" based on VIX levels to aggressively exploit extreme volatility events while maintaining strict risk controls.
